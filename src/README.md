Lab 4: TicTacToe Game
Members: James Fanning and David Greenwell

The code attempts to implement the psuedocode from pp9 along with the tic
tac toe code supplied in the same folder to create a learning AI to play
tic tac toe with the best outcomes. This is a command line program which
takes in the the amount of sessions, beta value and the selection mode
(random or max). Unfortunately due to time constaints and both
participants being enrolled in Senior Design, we did not have enough
time to get the implementation working. Please take that into
consideration.
