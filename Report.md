REPORT

Due to our program not working entirely as expected, 
this report is based on what our expectations were coming 
into this lab with the knowledge we learned from class. 

With varying beta values, a lower beta would result in more ties as the punishment/reward
system will not make drastic enough changes with a low beta. With a beta around .5, this will
be the best performing beta where it has the most wins and least losses. A high beta around 0.9 will result in a lot
of losses and wins because the program is overcompensating both ways too much. As a result, a beta of around 0.5
would likely be the optimal setting for a good classification.

The reward and punish model would most likely be the better performing model as it's actually making adjustments 
with each win and loss, rather than just on wins.
